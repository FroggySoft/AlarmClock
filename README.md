# AlarmClock
Alarmclock based upon a Arduino Uno with an 3.5 inch (320x480) TFT shield.

But it's not just an alarm clock with an RTC (DS1307). It will also:

- shows the current temperature and airpressure with the aid of an BMP180 digital barometer
- graphical display of the air pressure of the last 3 days
- sound the alarm using a mp3 player (DFPlayer Mini MP3 player)
- navigate through alarm settings with a cheap analoge thumbstick
- switch off the alarm with an PIR
- synchronise date and time with the DCF77 clock
- and ...
     show the weatherforcast for the coming 4 days transmitted with this same dcf77 signal.
